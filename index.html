						<section>
                        	<p>Wana Mama LLC is a private holistic Occupational Therapy practice. The services that are currently offered are sexual health and wellness services virtually. When in person sessions can resume safely, Wana Mama will continue to offer Abdominal Massage, body and energy healing services, education and support for women and those who love them. Wana Mama is passionate about providing a safe, clean, therapeutic environment for healing, restoration and building a community of kindness, inclusion and open dialogue about not only the challenges that women face but society as a whole; particularly regarding sexual health, pain and stress management.</p>
													<p>Wana Mama was created originally with a mission to help women process, heal, resolve challenges and find community associated with fertility, pregnancy loss, pelvic pain, pelvic and abdominal health conditions, pregnancy, child-birth, post-partum issues and parenting. Because these experiences were things that I was personally going through, I saw a gap in care and support and I felt the need to help close that gap. Since I launched Wana Mama in 2019, so much has happened that has generated growth and adaptation. Although the original vision is still true, Wana Mama has evolved and expanded to offer services that are more inclusive and offered to ALL who seek them. I look forward to life returning to some normalcy when I am able to safely provide abdominal massage, energy healing and functional Occupational Therapy services in person. Until then, I am proud and thrilled to be able to offer Sexual Health and Wellness services virtually!</p>

Since completing her Master’s degree in Occupational Therapy from Eastern Michigan University in 2006, She has lived all over the country and traveled the world with her husband and life partner, Alex.

							<h2> Healing Therapies Explained</h2>

							<header><h4>What is sexual health and wellness?</h4></header>
																<p>Sexual health is yet another under addressed aspect of humanity that MANY people struggle with. People often struggle with sexual dysfunction and don't know if they should bring it up to their healthcare providers. They may not know how to bring it up and if they do, they may be afraid of what their provider will say or how they will respond to the question. This is unfortunate and is not their fault. In my view, it is the responsibility of the healthcare provider to inquire about sexual health with their clients, because we know that most clients wont.</p>
																<p>Healthcare providers are often missing an important opportunity to improve the health and wellness of so many lives if they would just ask this simple question "Do you have any concerns about your sexual health?"</p>
																<p>Sex is an ADL or Activity of Daily Living and a very important one! It brings joy and pleasure to our lives. It can give us a sense of self. It can relieve stress. It can bond us with others and it is the pathway for reproduction. It can also be very confusing and a source of emotional and physical pain. Occupational Therapists are experts at looking at a person holistically, breaking down tasks to identify where the problem is coming from. The OT will then create realistic, client-centered goals and provide treatment interventions and education to help the client achieve those goals.</p>
																<p>As an Occupational Therapist, I have the privilege of shedding light on the topic of sexual health to help people establish or resume satisfying and safe sexual activity. It may be while recovering from a physical injury or illness or perhaps adapting to a permanent life changing event. Additionally, depression, anxiety, stress, pain, PTSD, sexual violence or trauma and hormonal changes may be factors that affect sexual activity and satisfaction. You may be having difficulty maintaining intimacy, healthy communication and connection with your partner. Maybe you want to explore new and interesting ways of having sex but don't know where to start. Some folks want to explore themselves as an individual sexual being. Wana Mama provides open, non-judgmental dialogue and  compassionate support to all who seek it, regardless of race, gender identity or sexual orientation.</p>

 							<header><h4>What is pelvic floor dysfunction?</h4></header>
                         				<p>Pelvic muscle weakness, dysfunction, and pain is very common among both men and women and unfortunately, is not a very openly discussed topic. Please know that you are not alone and there is help! Pelvic floor therapy can improve or resolve your symptoms! Common pelvic floor issues may include ‘stress’ incontinence, meaning urine leakage with coughing, sneezing, lifting, jumping, etc. ‘Urge’ incontinence, meaning you have a strong urge and leak urine when making your way to the restroom, for example. Some may experience both. Many women experience pelvic organ prolapse or shifting of organs/tissue from their original location. There are also various types  pelvic pain such as endometriosis, pelvic area scar tissue from C-section, other surgeries, episiotomy or tearing during child birth, nerve pain and pain with intercourse or sexual activity. The health of your pelvic floor muscles and tissues, the surrounding muscles that support this area, your emotional health, and digestion can make a big impact on your overall pelvic floor health and function. Janelle offers a free 15-minute consultation. Talk to her today!</p>

							<header><h4>What is Occupational Therapy (OT)?</h4></header>
                        				<p>OT’s help their clients find function, balance and satisfaction in life. An OT focuses on physical, social and emotional well-being. Every person is completely unique and OT’s use a holistic therapeutic approach to achieving health and wellness for each of their clients. An OT can help individuals of all ages engage in whatever matters most to them and meets their personal needs and level of function. You may find OT’s working in schools, hospitals, nursing facilities, in homes or out in the community.</p>
																<p>Perhaps you suffer from muscle tension, weakness and poor posture after spending so much time in less than ideal positions like driving, hunched over a desk, computer or phone, or caring for others. Maybe are recovering from an injury, surgery or serious illness or you may be adapting to a ’new normal’ such as an amputation, mastectomy, or menopause, your OT can help you set goals, and provide strategies and treatments to achieve successful outcomes.</p>
																<p>OT’s are experts at analyzing function, breaking down tasks to tease out the source of the problem, adapting and modifying tasks or activities and coming up with creative, client-centered solutions to help their clients.</p>
																<p>If you have never met an OT you should, you’ll love them!</p>

							<h2>Testimonials</h2>
						</header>
						<section>
                        <p><blockquote>In early 2015 Janelle Kloske delivered a presentation to a large group of employees at Brown and Caldwell regarding health and wellness both in the office and out.  She discussed helpful topics such as proper nutrition, stretching techniques, correct office ergonomics, and how to balance stress through meditation.  Her professional advice and calm demeanor allowed those in attendance to set up the proper building blocks to live a healthier lifestyle in the office and at home.  I hope that one day we could see another one of her presentations, as they are invaluable.  Anyone and everyone can benefit from her advice and guidance.

                        </p>

                        <p><blockquote>Janelle and I became friends when she and I both lived on Guam.  I watched her build her business from scratch and became a client of hers.  At first, I went to Janelle for body work, but then chose to explore Reiki with her as my guide.  I had not done energy healing prior and she was extremely knowledgeable and created a very safe environment for me to relax and channel the power of Reiki healing.  I miss her greatly and if I were in San Diego, I would be still using her as my guide. <br></blockquote>
