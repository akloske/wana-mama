							<h2>Who is Janelle?</h2>
						</header>
						<section>
                        <p>Janelle has been practicing Occupational Therapy since 2007 and has explored several areas of OT from inpatient physical rehab settings, hospitals, mental and psychological health, elementary education and running her own practice for health and wellness. No matter the setting, Janelle has always incorporated complementary and alternative therapies into her practice. Since the birth of her second child, she has decided to pursue a new professional endeavor; helping women and mothers nurture their health and well-being. </p>
                        <p>Janelle was raised in Holland, Michigan. Since completing her master’s degree in Occupational Therapy from Eastern Michigan University, she has lived all over the country and traveled the world with her husband and life partner of nearly 20 years, Alex. Recently, Janelle and her family relocated back to Holland and found the timing to be perfect to pursue this very exciting venture. Janelle is a proud mama to two beautiful energetic little boys. She enjoys adventuring, traveling, music, dancing, playing pool and being outside in the fresh air doing anything fun! <p>

                        				<p>Reiki an energetic healing method using gentle touch on or close to the body with a focus on chakra clearing, balance and relaxation.

							<header><h4>What is Occupational Therapy (OT)?</h4></header>
                        				<p>OT’s help their clients find function, balance and satisfaction in life. An OT focuses on physical, social and emotional well-being. Every person is completely unique and OT is a holistic therapeutic approach to health and wellness. An OT can help individuals engage in whatever matters most to them and meets their personal needs. For example; help moms strengthen the pelvic floor after child birth so that she can jump and play with her child or go to that jazzercise class with confidence. An OT can show her clients stretches and strengthening exercises for the chest, back and core for moms who suffer from muscle tension and poor posture after spending so much time holding and nursing their little ones in those inevitably strange positions.</p>

							<h2>Testimonials</h2>
						</header>
						<section>
                        <p><blockquote>In early 2015 Janelle Kloske delivered a presentation to a large group of employees at Brown and Caldwell regarding health and wellness both in the office and out.  She discussed helpful topics such as proper nutrition, stretching techniques, correct office ergonomics, and how to balance stress through meditation.  Her professional advice and calm demeanor allowed those in attendance to set up the proper building blocks to live a healthier lifestyle in the office and at home.  I hope that one day we could see another one of her presentations, as they are invaluable.  Anyone and everyone can benefit from her advice and guidance.

                        </p>

                        <p><blockquote>Janelle and I became friends when she and I both lived on Guam.  I watched her build her business from scratch and became a client of hers.  At first, I went to Janelle for body work, but then chose to explore Reiki with her as my guide.  I had not done energy healing prior and she was extremely knowledgeable and created a very safe environment for me to relax and channel the power of Reiki healing.  I miss her greatly and if I were in San Diego, I would be still using her as my guide. <br></blockquote>
