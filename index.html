						<section>
                        	<p>Wana Mama LLC is a private, holistic Occupational Therapy practice owned and operated by Janelle Kloske, Occupational Therapist. Janelle offers abdominal therapy, sexuality and intimacy guidance, body and energy healing and functional rehabilitation. Janelle's priority is to provide a safe, therapeutic environment for healing, restoration and self empowerment. This comes with a broader vision to help build a community of kindness, inclusion and open dialogue about the intimate struggles that we all face.</p>
													<p>When Wana Mama was established in 2017, the original mission was to help women process, heal, and find community in pregnancy, child birth recovery, fertility challenges, pregnancy loss, and pelvic and abdominal health conditions. When Janelle was personally experiencing all of the above, she saw a gap in support and felt the need to be a resource for those who were going through similar challenges. Since Janelle officially launched Wana Mama in 2019, so much has happened that has generated growth and adaptation. Although the original vision is still true, Wana Mama is not just for women and mothers. The services offered at Wana Mama are available to ALL who seek them.</p>

							<h2>Who is Janelle?</h2>
						</header>
						<section>
                        <p>Janelle was raised in Holland, Michigan. Since completing her Master’s degree in Occupational Therapy from Eastern Michigan University in 2006, She has lived all over the country and traveled the world with her husband and life partner, Alex. In 2017, after the birth of her second child, Janelle created the concept of Wana Mama. In early 2019, she and her family relocated from Denver back to Holland and found the timing to be perfect to make Wana Mama a reality. Since then, Janelle studied Pelvic Floor Rehab and Yoga for Pelvic Pain with Herman and Wallace and became an Abdominal Therapy Pracitioner with the Arvigo Institute and the Abdominal Therapy Collective. She has clinical experience in many healthcare settings; Most recently with Spectrum Health in the Neuro Rehab Services Home Care division. In that role, she worked with people of all ages recovering from traumatic brain injuries, neurological and orthopedic injuries caused by car accidents. This is where her work in sexual health and abdominal therapy started to flurish and she was able to witness beautiful outcomes in her clients. Now she has the privilage of providing these services in her private practice.</p> <p>Janelle's most recent life changing journey was receiving a breast cancer diagnosis in September of 2021. She underwent a bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction in November 2021. Today she is healthy and is officially a breast cancer survivor!</p> <p> Janelle is the proud Mama of two beautiful and energetic little boys. She enjoys tending to her city farm, hiking, paddle boarding, plunging into Lake Michigan, and yard parties!</p>

							<h2> Healing Therapies Explained</h2>
						</header>
						<section>
							<header><h4>What is sexual health and intimacy?</h4></header>
																<p>Sexual health is a major area of human function that is a grossly under addressed aspect of health; and it is one that so many people struggle with. You may have a concern about your sexual health and have no idea how to address it or how to bring it up to your healthcare provider. You may also wonder if your provider will respond in a supportive way. This fear is common and well-founded. Healthy dialogue about sex is difficult to come by and is often an ignored subject all together. When it does come up, many providers are not very well equipped to manage it. It is Janelle’s mission to help change this by using two approaches. 1. Educate healthcare providers and the community to bring awareness to our personal biases around sex, to provide education and helpful strategies to engage in healthy and supportive dialogue. This will create trust in the patient/provider relationship, faciliate appropriate referrals, cultivate collaboration among healthcare professionals and result in higher quality of care and better outcomes for our clients and patients. 2. To create a safe, nurturing and empowering space for individually guided support around sexual health and intimacy.</p>
																<p>Sex is an ADL or Activity of Daily Living and a very important one! It can bring joy and pleasure to our lives. It can give us a sense of self. It can relieve stress. It bonds us with others and it is the pathway for reproduction. It can also be very confusing and become a source of emotional and physical distress. Sexual expression and sexual activity are a part of who we are as humans. Janelle is an expert at approaching a person holistically then breaking down barriers to identify where a problem may be coming from and then provides treatment, resources, and support to help you achieve your unique personal goals.</p>
																<p>You may encounter obstacles that hinder sexual activity while recovering from a physical injury or illness or perhaps adapting to a permanent life changing event. Additionally, depression, anxiety, stress, and pain may be factors that affect sexual participation and desire. Perhaps you are having difficulty maintaining intimacy, healthy communication and connection with your partner. Some may want to explore themselves as an individual sexual being. Janelle provides open, non-judgmental dialogue and compassionate support to all who seek it, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, sexual identity, religion, or socioeconomic status.</p>
																<p>Note: Janelle has an ethical and professional obligation to stay within the Occupational Therapy scope of practice. If needed, an appropriate referral will be provided.</p>

							<header><h4>What is abdominal therapy?</h4></header>
                        				<p>The abdominal therapy method that Janelle uses was developed by the work and teachings of Rosita Arvigo. Abdominal therapists and those who have received abdominal therapy report that many common symptoms are alleviated by these techniques and organ functions are supported and enhanced. Abdominal therapy may improve symptoms of painful or irregular menstrual cycles, PMS, cysts and fibroids, scar tissue, displaced or prolapsed pelvic organs such as bladder or uterus, endometriosis, fertility challenges, menopausal symptoms, and digestive issues</p>
																<p>Abdominal therapy is offered as a supportive modality to enhance health and wellness, and is not meant as an entire approach to health care. If you have any serious medical conditions, please consult your health care provider first.</p>

							<header><h4>What is reflexology?</h4></header>
                        				<p>Reflexology is an energetic and gentle healing method focusing on the hands, feet and face to access the systems of the body, body structures and tissues to promote energetic balance, healing from within and relaxation. The client will be clothed throughout treatment. </p>
                        				<hr />

                        			<section>
							<header><h4>What is reiki?</h4></header>
                        				<p>Reiki an energetic healing method using gentle touch on or close to the body with a focus on chakra clearing, balance and relaxation. Reiki can be performed on areas of restriction, disease or injury throughout the body. The client will be clothed throughout treatment.</p>
                        				<hr />
                       				 </section>
															 <section>
 							<header><h4>What is pelvic floor dysfunction?</h4></header>
                         				<p>Pelvic muscle weakness, dysfunction, and pain are very common among both men and women and unfortunately, is not a very openly discussed topic. Please know that you are not alone and there is help! Pelvic floor therapy can improve or resolve your symptoms! Common pelvic floor issues may include ‘stress’ incontinence, meaning you leak urine with coughing, sneezing, lifting, jumping, etc. ‘Urge’ incontinence, means you have a strong urge to urinate and may leak urine when making your way to the restroom, for example. Some may experience both. Many women experience pelvic organ prolapse or shifting of organs/tissue from their original location. There are also various types of pelvic pain such as endometriosis, pelvic area scar tissue from C-section, other surgeries, episiotomy or tearing during child birth, nerve pain and pain with intercourse or sexual activity. The health of your pelvic floor muscles and tissues, the surrounding muscles that support this area, your emotional health, and digestion can make a big impact on your overall pelvic floor health and function.</p>

                        				 </section>
																 <section>
							<header><h4>What is Occupational Therapy (OT)?</h4></header>
                        				<p>OT’s help their clients find or restore meaningful activity, balance and satisfaction in life. An OT focuses on an individuals unique physical, social and emotional well-being.</p>
																<p>Perhaps you suffer from muscle tension, weakness and poor posture after spending so much time in less than ideal positions like driving, hunched over a desk, computer or phone, or caring for others. Maybe you are recovering from an injury, surgery or serious illness or perhaps adapting to a permanent life changing event such as an amputation, mastectomy, or menopause. Janelle can help you set goals, and provide strategies and treatments to help you find relief, heal and feel your best.</p>

							<h2>Testimonials</h2>
						</header>
						<section>
                        <p><blockquote>In early 2015 Janelle Kloske delivered a presentation to a large group of employees at Brown and Caldwell regarding health and wellness both in the office and out.  She discussed helpful topics such as proper nutrition, stretching techniques, correct office ergonomics, and how to balance stress through meditation.  Her professional advice and calm demeanor allowed those in attendance to set up the proper building blocks to live a healthier lifestyle in the office and at home.  I hope that one day we could see another one of her presentations, as they are invaluable.  Anyone and everyone can benefit from her advice and guidance.

                        </p>

                        <p><blockquote>Janelle and I became friends when she and I both lived on Guam.  I watched her build her business from scratch and became a client of hers.  At first, I went to Janelle for body work, but then chose to explore Reiki with her as my guide.  I had not done energy healing prior and she was extremely knowledgeable and created a very safe environment for me to relax and channel the power of Reiki healing.  I miss her greatly and if I were in San Diego, I would be still using her as my guide. <br></blockquote>
